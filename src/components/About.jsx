        I’m a self-taught developer with an economics & accounting background.
        I like building practical tools that solve real problems for users:
        clean UIs, reliable APIs, and simple data workflows. I’m actively looking
        for junior software or data roles in fintech/tech where I can learn fast,
        ship features, and contribute to a supportive engineering culture.
